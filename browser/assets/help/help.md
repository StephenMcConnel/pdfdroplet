# Getting Started with PdfDroplet

While PdfDroplet can work with pages of any size, the following illustrates using pages laid out as A5 **pages** for printing on A4 **paper** (A4 is twice the size of A5).

## Step 1

![Step 1](/help/help1.png)

Prepare your book using a word processor or page layout application.

## Step 2

Save or print your document as a PDF.

## Step 3

Drop that PDF onto PdfDroplet. This creates a new PDF document sized for A4 paper. The pages are reordered so that they will make a booklet when you fold down the middle. (Shown here printed as single-sided proofs.)

## Step 4

Print the booklet PDF on both sides of the paper. Fold down the middle, then fasten the folded edge with staples or thread.

## More Info

The new PDF document is put in the same folder as the original document and is given the same name but with "-booklet" added to the end. Nothing happens to the original document.

As shown, PdfDroplet normally doubles the original paper size to create a booklet. So dropping a PDF document formatted for A5 paper creates a PDF booklet sized for A4 paper; an A4 document creates an A3 booklet; a document sized for 8.5" x 11" paper creates a booklet on 11" x 17" paper; and so on. To make a user-printable booklet from a normal-sized document, use the 50% reduction option on the Convert tab to shrink the booklet pages so they fit on normal-sized paper.
